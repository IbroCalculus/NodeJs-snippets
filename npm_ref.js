/*
NPM is a package manager for Node.js packages, or modules
npm (Node Package Manager) is the Node.js equivalent of Python's pip. 
Both are package managers that allow you to manage and install libraries or dependencies for your project.

Whereas Python libraries are hosted on PyPI (Python Package Index). Node.js libraries are hosted on the npm registry.

============ INSTALLING PACAKGE ==============
npm install <package_name>

============ CREATING PACAKGE ==============
create a directory for the package and a file in it (ie index.js)

In CMD:
npm init            // And follow the steps. After completion, this will create a package.json file in your current directory.
 OR
 npm init -y         // Use this if you don't want to answer any questions. This will create a package.json file with default values.
